          description: "In a decisive and calculated attack , India launched \"Operation Sindoor,\" striking nine identified terrorist camps across Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This long-anticipated retaliation comes just two weeks after the brutal April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, which claimed 26 lives, including those of Indian and Nepali civilians. This operation has showcased that India will not tolerate any act of sponsored terrorism.",

          description: "Greetings from the Public Policy and Opinion Cell at IIT Kanpur! Pahalgam once a peaceful place, cradled by the Himalayas, but now it carries the marks of suffering—a painful reminder of how easily calm can vanish. What was once filled with joy and tranquillity is now filled with sorrow and loss. As we grieve the young lives taken away too soon, we must keep their stories alive. This moment should not just be about sadness; it should be a moment to act. Let’s picture a world where valleys ring out with peace instead of violence, where families don’t live in fear, and children don’t have to escape from the sounds of danger. Let us rise above apathy and work together for a future where every place on our Earth can thrive in safety, freedom, and peace.",
